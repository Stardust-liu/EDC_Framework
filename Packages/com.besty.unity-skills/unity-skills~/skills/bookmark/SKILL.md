# Bookmark Skills

Save and recall Scene View camera positions.

## Guardrails

**Mode**: Full-Auto required

**DO NOT** (common hallucinations):
- `bookmark_save` does not exist → use `bookmark_set`
- `bookmark_load` / `bookmark_restore` do not exist → use `bookmark_goto`
- `bookmark_remove` does not exist → use `bookmark_delete`
- Bookmarks save Scene View position + current selection, not scene state

**Routing**:
- For workflow snapshots (object state undo) → use `workflow` module
- For scene save/load → use `scene` module

## Skills
