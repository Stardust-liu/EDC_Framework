# Decal Skills

URP decal projector creation and configuration.

## Guardrails

**Mode**: Full-Auto required

**Routing**:
- For renderer feature management in general: `urp`
- For DecalProjector scene operations: this module

**Runtime-first rules**:
- Call `decal_ensure_renderer_feature` before assuming the current URP renderer is decal-ready
- Use `decal_get_info` / `decal_find_all` to discover real projector state before editing
- `decal_set_properties_batch` expects `items` to be a JSON array string
- This module targets the URP Decal workflow first; do not assume HDRP decal APIs are covered here

## Skills

### `decal_create`
Create a Decal Projector.

### `decal_get_info`
Inspect a Decal Projector.

### `decal_set_properties`
Modify Decal Projector properties.

### `decal_find_all`

### `decal_delete`
Delete a Decal Projector GameObject.

### `decal_set_properties_batch`
Batch-edit Decal Projectors.

### `decal_ensure_renderer_feature`
Ensure the target URP renderer has a DecalRendererFeature.
